# Library_Maintain
This is a small program for maintaining library books and keep record of the books using python as i don't have the books record so i have used the **Google Books API to get the different books**.

## What a user can do with this program :-

1. Search books in Library.
2. Borrow a book from Library.
3. Return a book to Library.
5. Delete a book.(Only for Admin) (Currently this option is not available beacause i am using Google Books API)
6. See the list of borrowed books and by whom they have borrowed with time and date.(Only for Admin)

## What i have learnt from this program:-

- How to import funtions from different files.
- Using Classes.
- **Using Google Books API.**
